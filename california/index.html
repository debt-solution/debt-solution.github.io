                    IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS: Programs range from 12-48 months. Not all
                    Clients complete the program. Estimates are based on prior results and
                    may not match your results. We cannot guarantee that your debts will be
                    resolved for a specific amount or percentage or within a specific
                    timeframe. We do not assume your debts, make monthly payments to
                    creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting, legal advice or credit
                    repair services. Program is not available in all states; fees may vary
                    by state. The use of these services will likely adversely affect your
                    credit. You may be subject to collections or lawsuits by creditors or
                    collectors. Your outstanding debt may increase from the accrual of fees
                    and interest. Read and understand all program materials prior to
                    enrolling.
                    <br><br>
                    Certain types of debts are not eligible for enrollment. Some
                    creditors are not eligible for enrollment because they do not negotiate
                    with debt consolidation companies.
