            <p><b>Last Updated: August 2020</b></p>
            <p>
                This is the online privacy policy for Debt Solution Network
                (sometimes referred to as the "Site," "Website" or "Landing Page"). This
                written policy (the "Privacy Policy") is designed to tell you about our
                practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that
                you may provide via this Website and certain related services. Please
                be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, or submitting
                information, to this Website.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy has been compiled to better serve those who
                are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII)
                is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information
                security, is information that can be used on its own or with other
                information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to
                identify an individual in context.

                and disclosure of information about you in the manner described herein.

                    IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS: Programs range from 12-48 months. Not all
                    Clients complete the program. Estimates are based on prior results and
                    may not match your results. We cannot guarantee that your debts will be
                    resolved for a specific amount or percentage or within a specific
                    timeframe. We do not assume your debts, make monthly payments to
                    creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting, legal advice or credit
                    repair services. Program is not available in all states; fees may vary
                    by state. The use of these services will likely adversely affect your
                    credit. You may be subject to collections or lawsuits by creditors or
                    collectors. Your outstanding debt may increase from the accrual of fees
                    and interest. Read and understand all program materials prior to
                    enrolling.
                    <br><br>
                    Certain types of debts are not eligible for enrollment. Some
                    creditors are not eligible for enrollment because they do not negotiate
                    with debt consolidation companies.
                    <br><br>
                    The company and its affiliates are not lenders, creditors, or
                    debt collectors. This is not a loan. Our debt consultants have helped
                    thousands of consumers throughout their careers.

                    Testimonials are actual customer experiences and individual
